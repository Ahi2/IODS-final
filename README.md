# IODS-final
This repository is created for the final assignment of the course, Open Data Science - University of Helsinki, Autumn 2017. 
In this exercise, I use the data from the Human Development Report to undestand the effect of standard of living on life expectancy. I also intend to understand whether variables relating to education, healthy living, and empowerment can explain different categories of country income. Throughout the report, I perform linear regression analysis as well as linear discriminant analysis.
